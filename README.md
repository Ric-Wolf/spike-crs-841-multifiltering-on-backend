## How to implement multi-filtering with the dropdown boxes, with reset and search with the information.

### Execution:

Go to localhost:3000 to see the sample page, there you have 3 dpboxes that filter between them.

the boxes have a color depending of the status, white if no filter is applied, green if the box is a filter, red if the information is being filtered and there are multiple choices and gray when is filtered but there is no choices other than the one displayed.

the print button shows the active filters, reset works as reloading the page

the original data relations is:

- Alejo: speaks english and spanish, is from colombia.
- Chris: speaks english, is from the US.
- Gary: speaks english, is from the US.
- Luis: speaks english and spanish, is from Panama.
- Orlando: speaks english and philippino, is from the Philippines.
